# Personal Development Report (PDR)

## 1. Learning Goal_1: I want to be able to not only analyze but also contrast different scheduling systems to identify the most efficient and effective solution for managing team schedules for a company.

### In My Own Words: 
My learning goal is to enhance my ability in analyzing different scheduling systems to find the most suitable and efficient way to manage team schedules within supermarket settings, in this case for the REWE supermarket. For that not only the necessity of understanding the specific needs of the supermarket is required but also the evaluation of the always constantly improving systems to meet the demands of the clients as effectively as possible.
To achieve this, I will research, analyze and compare the available systems in the market by processing as well as interpreting it to the current supermarkets IST situation.
I will first have to set the requirements that are demanded by the client to filter out systems that are not in line with the clients’ need. After that I will conduct a SWOT analysis for each system to further filter out the systems.
At the end I will have the most optimal system which will then be recommended to the client within the report in the advice chapter.

To align my aims to the LG I will have the plan set below on when to do what. The plannings may be taken earlier to finish this project faster. 

### Plan: 
<br> • Week_1-8: ---
<br> • Week_3: Interview with the company https://github.com/FontysVenlo/prj4-grouprepository-prj4b-01/edit/main/management/first%20interview.md</a> 
<br> • Week_9: Understand the needs of the supermarket then setting the requirements of the REWE https://github.com/SungSoo-Ri/prj4-BI--Individual/blob/main/Scope.md </a>
                    supermarket to find suitable systems to then continue with the SWOT analysis https://github.com/SungSoo-Ri/prj4-BI--Individual/blob/main/OLD%20SWOT </a> in the 
                    following weeks. 
<br> • Week_10-11: Setting more specific requirements to the REWE supermarket to filter more 
                            unsuitable systems out. Write specifications on the methodologies that were taken 
                            into consideration for the SWOT analysis and how it was done in general in the 
                            introduction. 
<br> • Week_12-13: After that conduct the SWOT analysis for the most qualified systems. After the 
                            selection of the most suitable system include it to the advice chapter in the report.
                            Furthermore, the MoSCoW methodology was used to get a more suitable system. Include also analysis https://github.com/FontysVenlo/prj4-grouprepository-prj4b-01/blob/main/API/Long-List%20of%20Contenders.jpg </a> and Advice at the end to come up with a system as a     
                            recommendation. https://github.com/FontysVenlo/prj4-grouprepository-prj4b-01/blob/main/API/api.md </a>

## 2. Learning Goal_2: Enhancing management skills in regards to monitoring, planning and coordination within projects

### In My Own Words: 
I want to enhance my ability in management and control skills by optimising my monitoring, planning and coordination within the project in terms of incorporating data analytics to ensure that it always meets the business objectives.
This includes setting clear deadlines and its objectives as well as to manage our resources which is time, as efficiently and effectively as possible to guarantee timely delivery.
Therefore, I will actively be responsible for the management of the scrum board to ensure that everything within it is timely by addressing the deadlines with my team members regularly and to cope with other unforeseen issues. 
The scrum board will regularly be updated to also understand the current flow of tasks which optimizes the processes within this project. But not only the scrum board will be used to manage the workflow but also WhatsApp. 
WhatsApp will be used for emergencies or other uncertainties that come up. On WhatsApp communicating the workflow is also possible. 
Other more extensive processes that need more collaboration will be held in a meeting via Microsoft Teams to ensure that everyone understand everything by sharing the screen and explaining the underlying issue. 
With this, a good working flow will be achieved which will prevent misunderstandings and lead us to progress easier.

### Plan: 
<br> • Week_1-13: Defining scope and objectives of the REWE supermarket. Understand stakeholders and employees wishes more. Proper resource allocation and deadlines for tasks. 
Establishing communication opportunities like WhatsApp and Teams for better collaboration. Giving feedback and sharing our current issues. Managing the scrum board [https://github.com/FontysVenlo/prj4-individual-portfolio-janneshatzius/blob/main/ExcerptAnalysis.md">Point 5.1](https://github.com/orgs/FontysVenlo/projects/352/views/1)</a>
