## Old Artefacts
Due to the many reorientations in the project, artefacts were initially created that are no longer of use. This includes the <a href="https://github.com/FontysVenlo/prj4-grouprepository-prj4b-01/blob/main/old%20Artefacts/ProjectCharter.pdf">old project charter</a>, which was revised because it contained too many errors, i.e. decisions were made in advance that should have emerged from the analysis. In addition to the analysis, I also initially wanted to select design instead of advise, which is why I created design artefacts for digital web-based software, which are no longer needed anymore and outdated. Because I switched from design to advise.<br><br>
