# LG1
 
## Retrospective: 
Due to the fact that my previous attempts (week 1-8) to write my PDR failed to meet the learning goals (LGs) with the expectations for PRJ4, I had to revise it multiple times. 
Although I had to revise the LGs, I received feedback that my PDR was well detailed. Therefore, I aimed to write the LGs with the same level of detail this time around.

In retrospect before this LG I can tell that I first had to think about the structure of the location in regards to how it structures its employees in departments. 
After having grasped the basic structure, I made an effort in finding suitable systems for the company. I also did the SWOT analysis for each of these systems to find the most suitable. 
But after getting advice from my Tutor Mr. Schwake I saw the whole selection of systems in a different perspective. 
My Tutor advised me to first find requirements for a “kick-off” to filter any unnecessary systems that will not be needed by the REWE supermarket anyway. 
By eliminating a system that does not fulfill one requirement, I could have more suitable systems to recommend in the report for the supermarket chain. 
And even though I applied it, I still think that the requirements I set are lacking thus I am adding more to it as I was also advised to be more specific or misunderstandings could arise within two parties. 
To keep it professional and to prevent such issues I therefore took it by heart to implement like that in the future too. 
I think in general the advice I got was very crucial for me in understanding how to be more effective in understanding how a professional would work for which I am very appreciative of.
It was difficult to specify the measurements for the user friendliness criteria as it needed very precise descriptions. But these were very difficult to mention as I never actually used all systems. 
But I thought that by limiting the requirements I could have more concise requirements to filter out the systems.

So first I used the three main knock-criterias which are the price the concurrent users as well as the easy use in the sense of an intuitive user interface. 
By then setting their measurements especially when doing it for the costs I could easily kick off a lot of expensive and therefore not useful systems. 
Then applying the easy user interfaces and concurrent user additionally I kicked off even more systems.
After applying the knockout-criteria, I had still a few systems left and decided to then apply the SWOT to see their differences again.
Additionally, I was advised that I needed to find a better solution in finding more suitable systems as SWOT analysis are not very effective for its measurements. 
And since I did not try the systems on my own, I could not really tell their usefulness myself which strengthen the point on why I need a better way to filter and select a suitable system. 
To find it, I then decided to also use the Moscow methodology as mentioned before, it was not sufficient enough to select a suitable system with just the SWOT analysis and the Knockout-criteria. 
Therefore, I also included the Moscow methodology to conclude what the company needs the most. 
And by prioritizing the needs I can see which of these systems have the most must-haves with which then I can decide easier the more suitable system for the supermarket.

Starting with Moscow analysis is not the most effective approach as it assumes a limited scope, focuses on a narrow set of factors, and may not consider all the important criteria. 
Instead, it's recommended to begin with knockout criteria to identify the most critical requirements and eliminate options that don't meet them, 
followed by SWOT analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the situation and identify potential areas for improvement. Finally, Moscow analysis can be used as a final step to prioritize options based on their market size and growth potential. 
This order ensures that you're considering all the important factors and prioritizing options that best meet your needs.

## Retrospective: 
Due to the fact that my previous attempts (week 1-8) to write my PDR failed to meet the learning goals (LGs) with the expectations for PRJ4, I had to revise it multiple times. 
Although I had to revise the LGs, I received feedback that my PDR was well detailed. Therefore, I aimed to write the LGs with the same level of detail this time around.

To define the scope and objectives of the REWE supermarket project, we needed to delve deeper into understanding the stakeholders' and employees' wishes (which we conducted with the interview in Week 3). 
Proper resource allocation in our example was time and especially the setting of deadlines for tasks are crucial to ensure smooth execution of our plans and finish the project in time. 
Additionally, establishing communication channels such as WhatsApp and Teams are facilitating us with a better collaboration among my team members and myself. 
These platforms also help us to give feedback and share current issues effectively in time to eliminate any disruptions to the plan we did. 
By managing the scrum board https://github.com/orgs/FontysVenlo/projects/352/views/1 </a>, we further enhanced and will enhance our project management processes which will allow us to track our progress and make necessary adjustments if needed again https://github.com/FontysVenlo/prj4-grouprepository-prj4b-01/blob/main/Project_Management.md</a>.
We also used labels to sort them into Advice, Analysis and Design parts, by doing that we could associate the tasks easier to their specific categories.
