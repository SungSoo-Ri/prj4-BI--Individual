<h2>4. Scope</h2>
Our scope is needed to clearly define the limits and goals of a project. The scope helps ensure that the project stays on track by defining the specific objectives, and requirements from the stakeholders, and finding constraints that will be considered.
This is important for effective planning, workflow, and successful completion of business analysis activities.<br>
<h3>4.1 In scope</h3>
At first, we will have an Interview with the stakeholders. 
This will give us the information on how to analyse these business cases -> scheduling of employees. After that, we will start with analyse this business case on the given information from the interview. 
We will set our major focus on GDPR rules, KPIs and alternative APIs which meet the given requirements. All three points are divided into an analysis and advice phase. 
In the analysis, all the data is collected and presented in an understandable context in order to find out what the problem areas are. In order to be able to advise on how they can be improved. 
For this, it is probably necessary to conduct further interviews in order to find out and measure the exact requirements and KPIs. <br>
All artefacts can be seen in the work breakdown structure.<br>
<h3>4.2 Out of scope</h3>
Deploy or implement a complete working system out of the artefacts. We are not sure at this moment perhaps we could help the company to implement some of this advises, 
but this depends on how extensive the advice is and how much time is available at the end. Could also be the case that only parts will be implemented.<br>
